# plane change maneuver
# match periapsis?
# raise the apoapsis to some multiple k of the target apoapsis
# while encounter is more than 1km separation:
#   wait 1/2 the orbit's period
# wait until a safe distance from encounter node
# . . .
# keep burning the correct amount in the correct direction to keep target and prograde aligned
# keep the speed relative to target below a certain value
# . . .
# when within targetting range, set active vessel to point to target
# set target to point to active vessel
# use rcs to guide active vessel to target
